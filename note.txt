// npm start vs npm run?
// npm start -> used to run the start script
// npm run -> used to run any custom script defined in the scripts section


//package.json vs package-lock.json?
// package.json -> contains metadata about the project and its dependencies
// package-lock.json -> contains the exact versions of dependencies installed

//what is metadata?
// Metadata is data that provides information about other data. //
// It helps to describe the structure, content, and context of the data.//
//  In the context of package.json, metadata includes information such as the name of the project, version, description, author, license, and dependencies. //
// This information is used by npm to manage the project and its dependencies effectively.

//what is promise in js and why we need it in simple terms?
// A promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. 
// // We need promises to handle asynchronous operations in a more manageable way, avoiding callback hell and making the code easier to read and maintain. //
// Promises allow us to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous, making it easier to understand and work with.

//what is async and sync in js?
// Synchronous (sync) code is executed sequentially, meaning each operation must complete before the next one begins. 
// Asynchronous (async) code, on the other hand, allows multiple operations to run concurrently, enabling the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for an operation to complete. //
// Async code is often used for tasks that take time to complete, such as network requests or file I/O, to improve performance and responsiveness.

// what is callback function in js?
// A callback function in JavaScript is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after a certain event or operation is completed. 
// Callbacks are commonly used for handling asynchronous operations, such as reading files, making network requests, or responding to user interactions. //
// They allow us to define what should happen once the asynchronous task is finished.
